# Cloud Native CRM Service

This is an example of how you can use hurtle with CRM software. The CRM software is [Zurmo](http://zurmo.org/) and has been "cloudified" through the work of the [ICCLab's CNA initiative](http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/category/research-approach/themes/cloud-native-applications/).

Currently this service only creates the required resources but on the roadmap is:

* integration with the [ICCLab's Cyclops](https://icclab.github.io/cyclops/)
* integration with the [ICCLab's Watchtower](https://github.com/icclab/watchtower-common)
